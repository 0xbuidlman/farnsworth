# Farnsworth Launcher

A simple [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) based,
configurable launcher for systems connected to a TV. Farnsworth
is optimized for use with a remote control or game controller. There is no
"media" functionality, that is, no video or music library or support for
live TV. Farnsworth's purpose is to simply launch other applications and
get out of the way.
